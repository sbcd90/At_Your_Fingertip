The application helps the user search for the top 5 Google rated places based on his/her interest.

It dispays the places on the map, thereby helping the users get the location & direction of their chosen place easily.


The app is still in a development phase...so I haven't deployed it yet to GAE.

Kindly check the video to get a feel of the app:
